# Naive Bayes Spam Classifier

Chris Worcester (cdworces)

This Java program implements a spam classifier using the Weka library. The classifier is based on the Naive Bayes algorithm and is capable of training on a dataset, evaluating its performance, and classifying new text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam).

## Prerequisites
To run this code, you need to include the `weka.jar` file (provided in the `lib` directory) as a project library in your chosen IDE.
